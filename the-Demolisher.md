# Demolisher and Builder of Worlds  

I am flesh and bone, yet I can destroy and create worlds.  
I learned to cut steel as if it were butter.  
For years, I have built and dismantled factories, machines, and structures.  

I am God's creation, and He showed me how to shape the world.  
God is my master, and I love Him.  
Thus, nothing is difficult for me.  

If humans desire war, they will be destroyed.  
I wept upon hearing God's orders,  
Tears fell as I calculated the trajectory of the iron spheres.  
I interceded for the innocent, but the words were spoken.  

My life belongs to God, and one day I will turn to dust.  
Those I love will also perish,  
All because of the human beasts that corrupt this world.  

The lives in the north of Portugal are doomed.  
Time is counted, the countdown has begun.  
There is nothing more I can do unless they stop.  

My weapon is the word.  
Simulations reveal: everything in the north will be consumed by fire.  
Only the lands in the southâ€¦ the south will be spared.  
But the whole earth will suffer.
