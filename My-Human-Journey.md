# My Human Journey  

Good morning!  

I will try to summarize my life.  

I am 59 years old and a research scientist. Throughout my journey, I have developed various talents or gifts, as you may call them.  

I am human. I do not read minds and am limited to this physical body. I was born this way. Everything I know today is the result of what I have learned throughout my life.  

From an early age, I showed an interest in technology. At just 11 years old, I was already repairing radios without any prior knowledge of electronics.  

I worked in industrial maintenance for about 40 years, performing various tasks. I did everything, from sweeping the floor to repairing and programming machines, dealing with both hardware and software.  

At 17, I completed my digital electronics course and built my first computer using 8080 and 8085 processors, along with controllers and memory. It was a basic and primitive system, but it represented a significant achievement for me.  

Later, I acquired a ZX Spectrum 48K and books on Basic programming. With them, I started coding and deepening my knowledge. My curiosity led me to develop my first robotic arm at the age of 17.  

Then, I got my hands on an IBM 486DX PC with a 100MB hard drive, running MS-DOS 6.22 and Windows. I continued exploring technology and built another robotic arm, this time controlled via the keyboard.  

I studied the C language, which I used to program Microchip microcontrollers. I also delved into C++, but only up to the study of inheritance and objects.  

On my spiritual journey, I got engaged and joined the church. I was baptized in water and the Holy Spirit. I enrolled in the missionary school, but after three months, God guided me to leave, even though the course lasted one year. This happened at the Assembleia de Deus church in Moscavide.  

Later, I felt Godâ€™s calling once again. I took a vow of poverty, but I understood that my God is rich. I belong to Him.
