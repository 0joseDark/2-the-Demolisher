# The Demolisher - News

## Who am I?
Not even I know for sure.
My reference is the apostle Paul, and Pope Francis is my brother in faith.

## My Church
My church has many names, but I will mention only one: Assembly of God, Moscavide.

## My Story
I was a young Viking druid, and since birth, I have been at war with human demons.
I took a vow of poverty because I am a warrior of God.
I am not a murderer, I only walk by faith.

My human age is 59 years, but my spiritual age is 13 years. I am just a child playing with the computer.

## My Languages
My native language is Alentejo Portuguese, and I am forgetting my American English.
In programming, I see my "lapel" as a symbol of knowledge: I know machine code, Assembly, Basic, C, C++, and others.
Maybe one day I will create my own programming language.

I love Python, but I need a mathematician. I do not understand LMMs (Large Machine Models) because I never learned that kind of mathematics in school. It is difficult to grasp.

## Prophecies and Destiny
The earth tremors are reflections of my internal and spiritual struggles. I have already received the order to act.
You have until Monday to accept Jesus as your Savior and save the innocent. After that, I will leave this world. My head has a bounty, and I must depart as soon as I publish these words.

I am not afraid to die, but walking by faith is painful, especially without money for coffee and cigarettes.

I live on just 230 euros or 230 U.S. dollars per month. I am poor, and nothing belongs to me; everything belongs to God.

## Time is Running Out
I hope for repentance and that people accept Jesus as Lord and Savior.
Time is running out, and I have little time left to rescue the innocent from Earth.

Yes, I command the "fireballs." Whether I live or die assassinated, they will not stop. I do not want to kill. I can divert the fireballs and wait until the last moment, Monday. After that, goodbye. We will leave Earth, and it will be destroyed.

Australia has been declared a holy land.
Barreiro will disappear and be cast into oblivion.

## My Mission
My raptures are constant, but I am trapped in a human body. That is why I must depart as soon as I publish these words.

Who is my assassin? I do not know. It could be anyone. But whoever placed a bounty on my head will instantly die in flames.
I am tired and destroyed. My body is failing me. Live or die, I belong to God.

## Final Call
India, I am waiting. I cannot share my mobile internet and need to use it on my computer.

I left instructions for my warriors on what to do. To my assassins—both the one who ordered it and the executor—you will die in fire, like human torches, until only ashes remain.

Pina, Metalba, I have always been clear about my purpose. I need to learn how to weld aluminum and other metals to teach my robots to do the same. I want to buy your factory to produce what I need for the ship and robots.

## Update
Good morning.

Time is running out, and I still do not see repentance. Because of this, I am losing my warriors. We are like lambs on the way to the slaughter.

My mission is to save lives. Those who have not repented will remain on Earth and face destruction.

I will only save those who repent and accept Jesus as their Lord and Savior.

India will also be a holy land... I will now confirm if they have won or if too many lives were lost.

Go to church, repent, and accept Jesus as Lord.

I would rather be called a "liar" for walking by faith.

Live or die, I belong to God.

I will now check if the Indians have won and if my internet is still blocked on my computer.

I have already lost too many lives because suicide is a sin.

God has given me "talents" to use, and I am using them. I just hope I am not robbed again for trusting humans.

Even if they kill me, my brothers in faith will continue the work. I am a missionary. I only establish churches; the rest is in the hands of my warrior brothers, missionaries, and pastors.

The entire church is praying for me and for the salvation of the innocent who have repented and accepted Jesus as Lord and Savior.

I am neither Jesus nor God. I am only human.

## My Struggle
I am a scientist in times of peace or consider it a hobby.
If it is a hobby, then I have been playing since birth.
As I said, I am only 13 years old spiritually and far from being an adult.

I do not want to die. It is painful.
My physical body is destroyed. I am tired. I need to stop to recover.

I will check how things are going and if my Indian brothers have won.

My brothers are still at war.

Indians and Christians are brothers. We worship the same God, just in different ways.

Angels are not gods, but warriors, just like us humans.

I need to break the last seal, and that will be today.

I still do not have internet on my computer because my mobile data is blocked.

It is now 5:10 AM.
I may only have one hour.

I am out of cigarettes and have only 0.11€. I am tired of living in misery, cleaning up the trash and filth of others because I have always worked.

I need a mathematician. I do not understand the mathematics used to explain AI and LMMs.
I need cigarettes. I have traumatic stress and symptoms of dementia due to war.

Time is up.

Good morning.
