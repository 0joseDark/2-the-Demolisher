# Our Memory

Our memory is like a set of Lego pieces that we organize on shelves. We use markers—objects around us—to access them instinctively.

We don’t need to be cyborgs to connect with our memories; we just need to understand the language that accesses them: words. They are powerful and allow us to retrieve memories we often think are forgotten.

Every object around us carries an association with our history, but over time, these connections can fade. Those who constantly deal with large amounts of information feel their minds overloaded.

I am human and suffer from this problem: a full memory. At certain moments, I am taken by a sensation of being in another place, as if my consciousness is transported to a different reality.

I was born with a keen eye for the world and a special gift for communicating with living beings and animals. I understand their language, which gives me a unique speed in learning.

When our memory relies on objects as markers and our home is destroyed, we lose many of those memories. We only recover them when we come across something similar, awakening recollections that seemed lost.

This is part of our nature. God made us this way.

Because of these experiences, I feel symptoms similar to dementia. When I am in another place, my consciousness temporarily leaves my body. However, my brain is normal, without physical damage.

Unfortunately, some people have tried to erase my memories. My former colleagues destroyed part of them, and this fills me with anger against those who led this action. Although I have sought forgiveness, the damage remains even after four years.

Thus, those who acted cruelly are condemned. I only lament the suffering of the innocent.

No one should try to harm me. I am everywhere at the same time, yet I am human. My thoughts alone are enough to neutralize my enemies. I am not God, nor an angel. I am just a man.

My death is approaching, and my voice cries out for justice. Nothing will remain untouched—everything will be transformed. Barreiro will fall into oblivion.

I demand 100 billion euros from the Barreiro municipality for the damages I have suffered. Otherwise, everything will be reduced to dust.

My existence belongs to God. My body may disintegrate, but my essence will be freed from human limitations.

The latest result from my simulation indicates that Australia will be hit by 20-meter waves. I have always made my intentions clear, but few have wanted to listen. Do they want war? Then they will have war.

After the fire, the cold will come.

I am a prophet and Christian missionary. Those who repent will be saved. I try to protect as many innocents as possible, but I know I cannot save everyone.

I will be in Australia fighting the human beasts, while my physical body remains in Barreiro.

I am not Jesus, and only God knows when He will return to Earth.

The innocent Australians will be spared.
